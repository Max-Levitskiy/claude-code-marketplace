## What is this?

This repo is a [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) **plugin marketplace** — a Git repository that packages and distributes Claude Code plugins so anyone can install them in seconds. A plugin can bundle any combination of:

- **Slash commands** — custom `/commands` for repeatable workflows
- **Skills** — model-invoked capabilities that trigger automatically when relevant
- **Subagents** — specialized agents for focused tasks
- **Hooks** — automation that runs on Claude Code lifecycle events
- **MCP servers** — connections to external tools and data via the Model Context Protocol

## Install

**1. Add the marketplace** (one time):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Max-Levitskiy/claude-code-marketplace
```

**2. Install a plugin:**

```bash
/plugin install <plugin-name>@claude-code-marketplace
```

**3. Keep it current:**

```bash
/plugin marketplace update claude-code-marketplace
```

Prefer a UI? Run `/plugin` to open the interactive browser, pick a plugin, and install it there.
